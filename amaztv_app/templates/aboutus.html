			    <h1>About AMAZ TV</h1>
			    <p>AMAZ is an Asian American multiplatform network & studio that is focused on curating and creating content that is actually reflective of Asian Americans. Think early MTV meets BET but for Asian Americans. By focusing on what we know best, we provide interesting content for non-Asian Americans as well. We are in the process of developing relationships with content creators (writers, producers, directors, talent, etc) in order to create a list of content that we will produce. In order to support the creative community that work with us, we are working on putting together a studio - which will serve as a resource hub for our talent. Would love to further discuss with anyone who is interested!</p>
